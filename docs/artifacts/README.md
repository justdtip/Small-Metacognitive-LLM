Artifacts Directory
===================

This folder holds run outputs such as calibration blobs and quality‑vs‑budget reports. It is safe to clean.

Expected files (examples):
- metacog_calibration.json — confidence temperature, plan thresholds, budget clip
- budget_sweep_eval.json / .csv — sweep metrics for EM/F1, avg think tokens, leakage, ECE/Brier
