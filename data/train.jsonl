With 10 mice, I can distinguish between 2^10 = 1024 different states, which is more than enough to identify 1 specific vial out of 1000.\n\nMy approach:\n1. Use binary representation where each mouse represents a binary digit (bit)\n2. Number vials 0-999 and convert each number to 10-bit binary\n3. For each vial, if bit i is 1, include a drop from that vial in mouse i's mixture\n4. After 12 hours, the pattern of dead mice will give me the binary number of the contaminated vial\n\nThis allows me to identify the exact vial in one round of testing within the 24-hour timeframe.\n</plan>\n\n<exec>\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n**Setup Phase (First 12 hours):**\n1.

Each switch controls exactly one bulb. I can only go upstairs once to check the bulbs.\n\nThe key insight is that incandescent bulbs generate heat when they're on. So I can use both the on/off state AND the temperature of the bulbs to get information. This gives me three distinct states to identify three different switches:\n\n1. Bulb that is ON and warm\n2. Bulb that is OFF but warm (was recently on)  \n3. Bulb that is OFF and cool (has been off the whole time)\n\nMy approach will be to manipulate the switches in a specific sequence before going upstairs, using time and heat as additional information sources.\n</plan>\n\n<exec>\nHere's my strategy:\n\n**Step 1:** Turn the first switch ON and leave it on for several minutes (long enough for the bulb to heat up significantly)\n\n**Step 2:** Turn the first switch OFF\n\n**Step 3:** Turn the second switch ON and leave it on\n\n**Step 4:** Leave the third switch OFF the entire time\n\n**Step 5:** Go upstairs once and check each bulb\n\nWhen I get upstairs, I'll find three distinct states:\n- One bulb that is ON and warm/hot - this is controlled by the second switch\n- One bulb that is OFF but warm/hot - this is controlled by the first switch\n- One bulb that is OFF and cool - this is controlled by the third switch\n\nThis allows me to identify all three switch-bulb pairs from a single trip upstairs by leveraging both the electrical state and thermal state of each bulb.\n</exec>\n\n<eval>\nThis solution works perfectly because:\n- I'm using three distinct observable states (on+warm, off+warm, off+cool) to identify three switches\n- The heat property of incandescent bulbs provides the crucial third piece of information\n- I only need one trip upstairs to gather all necessary data\n- Each switch produces a unique combination of electrical and thermal states\n\nThe problem is completely solved with this approach.\n</eval>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nTurn the first switch ON for several minutes, then turn it OFF. Turn the second switch ON and leave it on. Leave the third switch OFF. Go upstairs once. The bulb that is ON corresponds to the second switch.

The other products either have multiple factorizations leading to special sums, or none at all.\n\nWhen S hears P say \"Now I know the numbers,\" S realizes that among all possible products, only 52 could have led to this conclusion, so the numbers must be (4,13).\n</exec>\n\n<eval>\nThe logic chain works:\n1.

N's floor > P's floor\n\nI'll start with clue 1 to determine P's possible floor/tag combinations.\n</plan>\n\n<exec>\n**Step 1: Use clue 1 to determine P's floor and tag**\nP's floor equals the number of sides on P's tag.\nAvailable floors: 2, 3, 4, 5\n- If P has Triangle (3 sides): P on floor 3\n- If P has Square (4 sides): P on floor 4\n- If P has Hex (6 sides): No floor 6 available\n- If P has Circle (0 sides): No floor 0 available\n\nSo P is either:\n- Floor 3, Triangle\n- Floor 4, Square\n\n**Step 2: Use clue 5 to constrain N's position**\nN's floor > P's floor\n- If P on floor 3: N on floor 4 or 5\n- If P on floor 4: N on floor 5\n\n**Step 3: Use clue 2 to determine R's position**\nR lives one floor above Square tag tenant\n- If Square tenant on floor 2: R on floor 3\n- If Square tenant on floor 3: R on floor 4  \n- If Square tenant on floor 4: R on floor 5\n\n**Step 4: Consider case where P has Square (floor 4)**\nIf P on floor 4 with Square:\n- From clue 2: R on floor 5 (one above Square tenant P)\n- From clue 5: N on floor 5 (higher than P's floor 4)\n- But R and N can't both be on floor 5! ✗\n\n**Step 5: Therefore P has Triangle (floor 3)**\nP on floor 3 with Triangle\n\nFrom clue 5: N on floor 4 or 5\nFrom clue 2: R is one floor above Square tenant\n\nSince P has Triangle, Square belongs to M, N, or R.\n\n**Step 6: Use clue 3 to constrain M**\nM doesn't live on floor 2 or 5, and not Triangle\nSince P has Triangle, this is consistent.\nM must be on floor 3 or 4, but P is on floor 3.\nSo M is on floor 4.\n\nCurrent assignments:\n- P: floor 3, Triangle\n- M: floor 4, (not Triangle)\n\n**Step 7: Determine remaining assignments**\nRemaining floors: 2, 5\nRemaining people: N, R\nFrom clue 5: N's floor > P's floor (3), so N on floor 4 or 5\nBut M is on floor 4, so N on floor 5.\nThis leaves R on floor 2.\n\nCurrent assignments:\n- R: floor 2\n- P: floor 3, Triangle  \n- M: floor 4\n- N: floor 5\n\n**Step 8: Assign remaining tags using clue 2**\nFrom clue 2: R (floor 2) lives one floor above Square tenant\nBut R is on floor 2, so Square tenant would be on floor 1, which doesn't exist! ✗\n\nLet me reconsider...\n\n**Step 9: Re-examine clue 2**\n\"R lives one floor above the Square tag tenant\"\nThis means Square tenant's floor + 1 = R's floor\n\nIf R on floor 2: Square tenant on floor 1 (impossible)\nIf R on floor 3: Square tenant on floor 2 ✓\nIf R on floor 4: Square tenant on floor 3 ✓  \nIf R on floor 5: Square tenant on floor 4 ✓\n\n**Step 10: Reconsider with P on floor 3, Triangle**\nP: floor 3, Triangle\n\nFrom clue 3: M not on 2 or 5, not Triangle\nM on floor 3 or 4, but P is on 3, so M on floor 4.\n\nFrom clue 5: N's floor > 3, so N on floor 4 or 5\nBut M is on 4, so N on floor 5.\n\nThis leaves R on floor 2.\n\nFrom clue 2: R (floor 2) = Square tenant floor + 1\nSo Square tenant on floor 1 (impossible!)\n\nLet me try the other case: P on floor 4 with Square.\n\n**Step 11: Re-examine M's constraints**\nActually, let me reconsider if M could be on floor 3 with P.\nBut each tenant lives on a different floor, so that's impossible.\n\nLet me try the other case: P on floor 4 with Square.\n\n**Step 12: Try P on floor 4 with Square**\nWait, I already showed this leads to contradiction. Let me be more careful.\n\nIf P: floor 4, Square\nFrom clue 2: R is one floor above Square tenant (P)\nSo R on floor 5.\n\nFrom clue 5: N's floor > P's floor (4)\nSo N on floor 5.\nBut R is also on floor 5! ✗\n\nThe issue is I assumed Circle has 0 sides.
